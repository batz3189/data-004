ACCESSING THE CD CONTENTS
To most easily surf the contents of the CD, you will need to have a web browser installed on your computer. If you already have a web browser installed, launch the application and open the file "D:\Readme.htm" (where "D" is the designation of your CD drive).

Follow the directions on screen to complete the installation. After successfully installing the web browser, launch the application and open the file "D:\Readme.htm" (where "D" is the designation of your CD drive).

DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNET EXPLORER 5 INSTALLATION
Internet Explorer 5 and Internet Tools Setup install the majority of its files on the drive where the Windows operating system is installed, regardless of the installation location you choose. To free up space on your hard disk in order to meet the Internet Explorer 5 disk-space installation requirements, you must free up space on the drive where the Windows operating system is installed.



Most the files have been prepared as web-ready (htm), Adobe Acrobat (pdf), and PowerPoint slideshows (pps). We’ve included these files in multiple formats to offer you greater viewing accesses than a single format would allow.
